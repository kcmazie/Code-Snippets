# Code-Snippets
A collection of functions and code bits that I use to standardize my scripts.

This is just a hodge-podge of random code bits that I've collected to allow me to standardize most of my scripts.

Files include:
GetConsoleHost.ps1 - A function that detects if you are running in an editor or the PS console.  I use it to enable my
                     "write-host" statements when using VS Code.
                 
GenerateGuid.ps1 - Use to create new random GUID        

LoadConfig.ps1 - A function to pull variables from an external XML file.
